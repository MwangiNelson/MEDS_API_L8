Here's a step by step procedure to set up this project, I'll split ito 2 sections (Backend && frontend)
For organization purposes, I suggest u make a new folder on your desktop. Name it `The Dawa`

##Pre-configs
------------
These are the requirements to run this project:
	1.php
	2.composer
	3.node js
	4.xampp 

Create a new db on your xampp phpmyadmin and name it `the_dawa_app`
Import the `dawa.sql` from the cloned project.[Check how to clone below.ðŸ‘‡] 

##Backend
----------
1. Clone project into the desktop folder
	`git clone https://github.com/MwangiNelson/MEDS_API_L8.git DAWA_BACKEND`

2. `cd` into the new folder
	`cd DAWA_BACKEND`

3. Install composer packages
	`composer install`

4. Get a new App Key
	`php artisan key:generate`

5. Confirm database
	Go to the `.env` file and confirm `DB_DATABASE = the_dawa_db`

5. Start the backend server
	`php artisan serve`

Server should be running on this port

1. Clone project into the desktop folder(make sure you're in the correct location)
